Overcome all the obstacles and solve the mystery of the missing expedition...

\section{Game description}

In  the year 2023, scientists from the Technical University of £Ûdü reached the milestone in the field of energetics. They managed to synthesize new fuel, extremely efficient, but unfortunately too expensive to be massively used. LoDeX, as they called it, was the combination of the dry ice and coal. Fifty grams of that substance could produce as much energy as the medium nuclear bomb. Unfortunately, due to it's price it had to stay in the shadows of the laboratories only...\newline\newline
Five years later, a probe sent to the moon discovered existence of the LoDeX in one of the craters. It was the chance to change the world's energetics and to solve many problems struggling the human race. Polish government started to organize the expedition of scientists from all over the world to analyze the space discovery. A group of fifty men took off from the Cape Canaveral on the June 23th. After a week of flight they reached the dark side of the moon...\newline\newline
First investigations confirmed existence of the LoDeX. Moreover, the deposit was much more extensive than it was expected before. Unfortunately, the members of the expedition and the equipment started to get lost under the mysterious circumstances. After three days the contact with the expedition was lost too.\newline\newline
The debate of the representatives from the countries taking part in the mission took place in Warsaw. It was decided to send the military unit consisting of ten fighters to the moon. You are the leader of that rescue team. Locate your base in the most appropriate place, produce the fighters and solve the mystery of the missing scientists...
